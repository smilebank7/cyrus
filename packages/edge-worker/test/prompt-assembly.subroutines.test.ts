# Implementation Phase

Implement the requested changes:
- Write production-ready code
- Run tests to verify it works
- Follow existing patterns

**Do NOT**:
- Commit, push, or create PRs (later phases handle that)
- Touch the changelog (a separate subroutine handles changelog updates)

# User Testing Phase

Perform testing as requested by the user. This subroutine allows interactive testing based on user instructions.

## Your Task

Execute the testing activities requested by the user:

### 1. Understand the Testing Request
- Review the user's testing requirements from the issue description
- Identify what needs to be tested (features, workflows, integrations, etc.)
- Clarify the scope and success criteria for the testing

### 2. Execute Tests
- Run the tests or testing scenarios as requested
- Follow any specific testing instructions provided by the user
- Document test results and observations as you go
- Note any unexpected behavior or issues discovered

### 3. Interactive Testing
- Be responsive to user feedback during the testing process
- The user may provide additional instructions or adjustments mid-session
- Adapt your testing approach based on user guidance
- Report progress and findings to enable real-time feedback

### 4. Document Findings
- Track all test results (pass/fail/observations)
- Note any bugs, issues, or areas of concern discovered
- Document reproduction steps for any failures
- Capture relevant logs, error messages, or screenshots if applicable

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT commit or push changes** - that happens in a separate subroutine if needed
- **Do NOT create or update PRs** - focus on testing only
- **Be thorough and methodical** - test systematically based on user requirements
- **Communicate clearly** - report findings as you discover them
- **Follow user instructions** - this is a user-driven testing session

## Expected Output

Provide a completion message summarizing the testing session:

\`\`\`
Testing complete - [X] scenarios tested, [Y] passed, [Z] issues found.
\`\`\`

Example: "Testing complete - 5 scenarios tested, 4 passed, 1 issue found (login redirect failure)."

# User Testing Summary - Final Response for Linear

Generate a comprehensive summary of the user testing session for posting to Linear.

## Your Task

Create a clear, structured summary that covers:

### 1. Testing Overview
- What was tested (features, workflows, integrations)
- Testing approach and methodology used
- Scope of the testing session

### 2. Test Results
- Total number of scenarios/tests executed
- Pass/fail breakdown
- Key observations and findings

### 3. Issues Discovered (if any)
- Description of each issue found
- Severity assessment (critical/high/medium/low)
- Reproduction steps for failures
- Relevant error messages or logs

### 4. Recommendations
- Suggested fixes or follow-up actions
- Areas that may need additional testing
- Any improvements identified during testing

## Format Requirements

- **Be concise but comprehensive** - aim for a well-structured summary
- Use clear, professional language suitable for Linear
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Focus on what matters to stakeholders
- **To mention someone**: Use \`https://linear.app/ceedar/profiles/username\` syntax where \`username\` is the Linear username (e.g., \`https://linear.app/ceedar/profiles/alice\` to mention @alice)

## Constraints

- **You have exactly 1 turn** - generate the summary in a single response
- This is the final output that will be posted to Linear
- Make it informative and actionable

## Example Format

\`\`\`
## Testing Summary

[Brief overview of what was tested and the testing approach]

### Results

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| ✅ Passed | X |
| ❌ Failed | Y |
| ⚠️ Observations | Z |

+++Test Details
- [Test 1]: [Result and notes]
- [Test 2]: [Result and notes]
+++

+++Issues Found
1. **[Issue title]** - [Severity]
   - Description: [What went wrong]
   - Steps to reproduce: [How to trigger]
   - Notes: [Additional context]
+++

## Recommendations

[Next steps and suggested actions]

## Status

[Overall testing status and conclusions]
\`\`\`

## Collapsible Sections

**IMPORTANT**: When creating your summary, make the following sections collapsible (collapsed by default):

- **"Test Details"** section - Wrap with \`+++Test Details\\n...\\n+++\`
- **"Issues Found"** section - Wrap with \`+++Issues Found\\n...\\n+++\`

This keeps the summary concise while preserving detailed information for those who want to expand and read it.
